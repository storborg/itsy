"""
A work queue implementation to serve itsy. Uses redis.

Basically the goal is to support these mechanisms:

    - Enqueue a crawl task (which is a Task instance)
    - Enqueue a crawl task to be executed no earlier than time X
    - Enqueue a crawl task at a high priority (high priority tasks have a
      separate queue which is always checked first)
    - Dequeue a crawl task

The rough idea is to use a sorted set per queue.

Enqueue like this:

ZADD todo <scheduled epoch> <task ID>

Then dequeue like this:

WATCH todo
element = ZRANGEBYSCORE todo 0 <current epoch> LIMIT 0 1
MULTI
ZREM todo element
EXEC

Which should be a nonblocking pop of the next task ID which has a scheduled
time prior to now.

TODO
- Figure out how to support a global rate limit or a per-domain rate limit.
